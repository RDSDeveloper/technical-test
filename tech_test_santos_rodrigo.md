### 5. Design Considerations, Tradeoffs, & Risks

#### 5.1 Design Tradeoffs

##### UX vs Security Tradeoffs

| UX Enhancement | Security Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Single OAuth flow | Reduced multi-factor options | Enhanced session monitoring and risk-based authentication |
| Persistent sessions | Increased session hijack risk | Short-lived JWT + secure HTTP-only refresh tokens |
| Photo upload simplicity | Potential metadata exposure | Server-side metadata stripping and secure URL generation |
| Quick trial activation | Payment fraud risk | Stripe radar integration + behavior monitoring |

##### Simplicity vs Functionality

| Simple Approach | Full Feature | Chosen Balance |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Basic role system | Fine-grained permissions | Role-based with trial states |
| Local file storage | Distributed CDN | S3 + CloudFront with signed URLs |
| Single region | Multi-region deployment | Primary region + read replicas |
| Synchronous processing | Event-driven architecture | Hybrid: Critical paths sync, background tasks async |

#### 5.2 Risk Analysis & Mitigation

##### Data Security Risks

1. **Sensitive Photo Data**
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to user photos
   - **Mitigation**:
     - End-to-end encryption for photo storage
     - Temporary signed URLs with short expiration
     - Access logging and anomaly detection
     - Regular security audits

2. **Payment Information**
   - **Risk**: Payment data exposure
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Stripe Elements for secure card collection
     - No storage of raw payment data
     - PCI compliance through Stripe
     - Regular security training

3. **Personal Health Information**
   - **Risk**: Skin condition data exposure
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Data encryption at rest and in transit
     - Strict access controls
     - Regular privacy impact assessments
     - Data minimization practices

##### Compliance Requirements

1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Explicit consent collection
   - Right to be forgotten implementation
   - Data portability support
   - Privacy by design approach
   - Regular impact assessments

2. **CCPA Compliance**
   - Clear data collection notices
   - Opt-out mechanisms
   - Data deletion workflows
   - Access request handling
   - Third-party data sharing controls

#### 5.3 Scalability Strategy

##### Database Sharding

1. **Sharding Approach**
   ```python
   # User data sharding strategy
   shard_key = hash(user_id) % NUM_SHARDS
   
   # Photo data sharding by date
   photo_shard = f"shard_{upload_date.year}_{upload_date.month}"
   ```

2. **Sharding Criteria**
   - User data: By user_id (even distribution)
   - Photos: By upload date (temporal access patterns)
   - Vector data: By user_id (co-location with user data)

##### Distributed Session Management

1. **Session Storage**
   ```python
   # Redis cluster configuration
   REDIS_CONFIG = {
       'cluster_mode': True,
       'nodes': [
           {'host': 'primary', 'port': 6379},
           {'host': 'replica-1', 'port': 6379},
           {'host': 'replica-2', 'port': 6379}
       ],
       'read_from_replicas': True
   }
   ```

2. **Session Strategy**
   - Short-lived JWT tokens (15 minutes)
   - Redis-stored refresh tokens
   - Cross-region session replication
   - Graceful failover handling

##### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - User profile: 5-minute cache
   - Photo metadata: 1-hour cache
   - Vector data: 15-minute cache
   - Cache invalidation on updates

2. **Load Distribution**
   ```python
   # Load balancer configuration
   LOAD_BALANCER_CONFIG = {
       'algorithm': 'least_connections',
       'health_check': {
           'interval': '30s',
           'timeout': '5s',
           'healthy_threshold': 2,
           'unhealthy_threshold': 3
       },
       'sticky_sessions': {
           'enabled': True,
           'cookie_name': 'DAB_ROUTE'
       }
   }
   ```

#### 5.4 Monitoring & Observability

1. **Key Metrics**
   - Authentication success rate
   - Trial conversion rate
   - Photo upload latency
   - API response times
   - Error rates by endpoint

2. **Alerting Thresholds**
   ```python
   ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
       'auth_success_rate': {
           'warning': 95.0,  # Percentage
           'critical': 90.0
       },
       'api_latency': {
           'warning': 500,   # Milliseconds
           'critical': 1000
       },
       'error_rate': {
           'warning': 1.0,   # Percentage
           'critical': 5.0
       }
   }
   ```

This design balances security requirements with user experience while ensuring scalability and compliance. The approach leverages FlyFlat's enterprise experience while adapting to Dab's specific needs in handling sensitive skin-related data and photos.

1. **Short-term Strategy**
   - Implement with conservative defaults
   - Add configuration flags for flexible updates
   - Document assumptions in code
   - Monitor usage patterns

2. **Medium-term Strategy**
   - Gather user feedback and metrics
   - A/B test different approaches
   - Regular stakeholder reviews
   - Iterative improvements

3. **Long-term Strategy**
   - Build self-service configuration
   - Implement feature flags
   - Create migration tools
   - Automated compliance checks

This section highlights areas where additional clarification would be valuable while providing reasonable defaults based on industry standards and best practices. The implementation remains flexible to accommodate future requirement changes.
